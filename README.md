# Image Steganography

This project is a simple GUI application built with Python that allows users to encode and decode hidden messages in images using steganography. The project uses the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and PIL (Pillow) for image processing.

## Features

- **Encode Text in Image**: Select an image and hide a secret message within it. The encoded image can then be saved for later use.
- **Decode Text from Image**: Select an image that contains a hidden message, and the application will reveal the hidden text.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Required Python libraries:
  - `tkinter` (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
  - `Pillow` for image processing

### Install Required Libraries

You can install the required libraries using pip:
